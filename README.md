# Network-IP-Traffic-Classification-with-ML

This is the implementation of machine learning technique for classification of network traffic. The dataset consists of more than 300000 flows from the network. nDPI was used to analze the flows and more than 100 types of application were found. Those application were divided into 7 classes amd then different ML algorithms were applied to classify them. 

# Results

Decesion tree 95.8% accurecy 

Randomforest 96.69% accuracy

KNN 97.24% accuracy

PAA 99.29% accuracy
